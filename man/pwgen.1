.Sh NAME
.Nm pwgen
.Nd generate passwords from various character sets
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pwgen
.Op Fl aeHhns
.Op Fl l Ar length
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility generates cryptographically secure, unbiased random passwords from the
ASCII character set, the alphanumeric character set, the hexadecimal character
set, or a simplified character set designed for ease of use on a U.S. QWERTY
keyboard. The passwords generated will be
.Ar length
characters long.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Use the typeable portion of the ASCII character, excluding whitespace
characters, to generate the password. This set corresponds to the range 33-126
in the ASCII character set.
.It Fl e
Use a simple character set designed for ease of use on a U.S. QWERTY keyboard
to generate the password, and enforce that there be at least one of each of
an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, a number, and a special character in
the result. This enforcement is performed in a manner that does not bias the
password. This option is the default behaviour of
.Nm .
See the
.Fl s
option for more details about the simple character set.
.It Fl H
Use the uppercase hexadecimal character set to generate the password. This set
consists of numbers and the letters 'A' through 'F'.
.It Fl h
Use the lowercase hexadecimal character set to generate the password. This set
consists of numbers and the letters 'a' through 'f'.
.It Fl l Ar length
The password generated will consist of
.Ar length
characters. The default is 20 characters.
.It Fl n
Use the alphanumeric set to generate the password. This set consists of the
ASCII lowercase and uppercase letters and numbers.
.It Fl s
Use a simple character set designed for ease of use on a U.S. QWERTY keyboard
to generate the password. This character set consists of all uppercase and
lowercase ASCII letters and numbers, and the special characters generated by
pressing shift while typing a number key. For greater clarity, 
.Dl ! \ @ \ # \ $ \ % \ ^ \ & \ * \ ( \  )
are the ten special characters.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
To generate a 15-character alphanumeric password:
.Pp
.Dl $ pwgen -n -l 15
.Pp
To generate a 16-character hexadecimal password:
.Pp
.Dl $ pwgen -h -l 16
.Pp
To generate a 20-character password with at least one of each of an uppercase
letter, a lowercase letter, a number, and a special character (this is the
default behaviour of
.Nm
if no command-line arguments are provided):
.Pp
.Dl $ pwgen -e -l 20
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility was released in September 2007. In August 2011, it was rolled into the
.Xr pisces 1
software package.
